A repository to document my Python learning journey

#  About Me
Hi, I'm Rocky. I'm from the Bay Area. I'm planning to double in math and computer science. I love swimming, card games, and video games. I have learned Python, Java, and other programming languages in mathematics, such as R and MATLAB. I'm currently learning C++ in West Valley, too. I would like to become a data scientist.

#  Goals for This Course
I want to improve my skills in solving more complex coding problems.

#  My First Python Program
```python
print("Hello, World!")
